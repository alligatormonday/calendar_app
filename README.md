# calendar_app

## Author: alligatormonday (Joseph Jepson)

## Technologies Used

* Bootstrap
* Moment.js

## Description 

This is my submission for my fifth homework assignment for the University of Arizona - Coding Bootcamp for Full-Stack Web Development program.

In this assignment I was tasked with creating a daily planner/calendar application that does the following: 
* Upon opening the application, the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar
* When viewing the timeblocks for the day, each timeblock is color coded to represent the past, present, and future
* User can click within the event for a given timeblock and type an event with saving capabilities
* Text for that event is saved in local storage
* When page is reloaded, then the saved event persists

I used pre-existing HTML and CSS (provided by the instructor) and modified it with Bootstrap. I coded the JavaScript from scratch and implemented _Moment.js 2.27.0_.

My main goal with this assignment was to gain a stronger understanding of _local storage_. I kept things simple. There's nothing special or unique going on in this code. But I'm really proud of it's simplicity. This is the first assignment that I probably spent the least amount of time on, but not to the detriment of the assignment. 

Understanding _moment.js_ is still something I do not feel super comfortable with, yet. However, this was the first time I've seen it, or used it. 

Overall, this was a fun assignment that was definitely challenging but it made a lot of sense and wasn't too difficult.
